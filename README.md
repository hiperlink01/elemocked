# elemocked
Final project of Programming Techniques class. A CLI-based exploration game in C.

There are two versions I'm uploading to this same repo:
1 - One refuses to compile since I can't seem to figure the files' interdependencies; can be found inside: Elemocked/
2 - The other, works, as it's everything stuffed inside the same .c file, no custom header files for this one; can be found inside: 2aTentativa/
